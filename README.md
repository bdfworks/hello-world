# hello-world
github's tutorial test repository

My name is Benjamin Fitch.  I'm a wannabe game designer and modder, but hope to go pro someday.  I've grown up learning how to program computers, starting in first grade afterschool and summer programs, and later took my first programming tutorials, (for hypercard), before hitting pubery.  However, I've learned that I much prefer designing to hard coding. Go figure...
