My name is Benjamin Fitch.  I'm a wannabe game designer and modder, but hope to go pro someday.  I've grown up learning how to program computers, starting in first grade at a magnate school's after school program. I continued learning with summer school, and also took tutorials deciphered code on my own.  I designed my first game, and wrote my first video game before high school. Continued taking computer science courses through high school, and studied the same in college at the University of Texas in Austin. There I learned that I much prefer designing to hard coding, however, and ended up graduating with a Bachelor's of Arts.
